# Megabyte burner 2000

money isn't spent (even if it says otherwise), it's more a treshold
it seems to be Bitburner in it's very early stages of development
there is no real JavaScript, it's Netscript - it's own scripting language
the scripts are slower - they follow an internal clock
can't use functions for instance, no lambdas etc
Strategy:
the easiest at first is to go for Hacknet nodes and upgrade them constantly
upg.script does that.. it generates a bit of money which should be 
enough for the first few augmentations
learn hacking - travel to Volhaven, go to zb institute and start the Algorithm course
getting TOR is easy in the City, buy the cracks with 'buy crackname.exe' - list  with 'buy -l'
upgrade your home server RAM while at it..

unfortunately you can't chain cli commands with ; so one by one :/ 
groups.script tries to hack groups servers as they always require to hack the same servers
to get faction rep, i just did 'hacking contracts' for them, seems good enou
to gain more money and hacking exp, we need to hack servers - that can be done with whg.script, run it with more threads.. upgrade your RAM in the City

## snippets

```shell
buy DeepscanV1.exe
buy DeepscanV2.exe

 
buy BruteSSH.exe 
buy FTPCrack.exe 
buy relaySMTP.exe
buy HTTPWorm.exe 
buy SQLInject.exe

# Create the AutoLink program yourself.. doesn't take long and it's useful

run groups.script
# the script doesn't make the faction invitations to popup :(
# therefore go find the servers by hand and 'hack' them after they are opened by the script

run upg.script

# adjust numbers 
run whg.script -t 1000 foodnstuff
run whg.script -t 1000 joesguns
